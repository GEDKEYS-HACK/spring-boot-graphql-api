## Project Structure

The project follows a layered architecture. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the structure:

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java/

â””â”€â”€ build.gradle
```

- **controller/**: Contains the API endpoints.
- **service/**: Business logic goes here.
- **repository/**: Data access layer.
- **model/**: Data models and entities.

## API Endpoints

This API exposes several endpoints. Here are some examples:

- **Get All Items**
  - **Query**: `query { items { id name } }`
  
- **Create Item**
  - **Mutation**: `mutation { createItem(name: "New Item") { id name } }`

Refer to the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) for more details on how to structure queries and mutations.

## Authentication

This API uses JWT for authentication. To access protected endpoints, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

To obtain a token, send a POST request to the login endpoint with your credentials.

## Testing

Unit tests are included in the `src/test/java` directory. You can run the tests using:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

This will execute all tests and provide you with a report.

## Deployment

You can deploy this application using Docker. Hereâ€™s how to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t spring-boot-graphql-api .
```

Then run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-boot-graphql-api
```

This will expose the API on port 8080.
